# Airquality Exporter

The airquality-exporter provides metrics from environmental sensors to give insights about the airquality in a room. The exporter requires the environmental sensors BME280 (for temperature, humidity and pressure) and SGP30 (carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds).

## Development

Build the exporter using the Makefile

```shell
make build
```

Run the exporter

```shell
make run
```
